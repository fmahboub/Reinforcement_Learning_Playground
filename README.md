# Reinforcement Learning Playground

A repository devoted to reinforcement learning experimentation. Using Gym and Stable_Baseline3, a series of increasingly complex two dimensional challenges are faced by an agent trained by an actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm.

The specific algorithm used: https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/modules/a2c.html

## Challenge 1
### Learn to navigate to the bottom left corner of the grid
